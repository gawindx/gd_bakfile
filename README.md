How It Work

It will get "Acces Token" and "Refresh Token" and he'll automatically get new "Acces Token" when expired.
With "Acces Token", he'll verify that remote directory exist, if not he'll create him, and get his ID's.
He'll search into remote directory for all file in it.
Tehn, he'll look into local directory for file to backup.
All files that are presents on remote directory but not on local directory will be destroyed.
All file that are present both on remote directory and local will  not be saved (only if are not of the same size, in this case the remote file 
is erased and local file is uploaded again).
All files that are only present on local directory are uploaded to remote directory.
By default, all file larger than 1Mb are uploaded in "resumable" mode with parts of 1Mb.

In case Of trouble
You can delete the config file (/etc/default/gd_bakfile.conf), it contains all answers from the 5 questions.
You can also delete the file /usr/local/bin/.gd_bakfile.opt who contains "Acces Token", "Refresh Token" and expiration timestamp of "Acces Token".
